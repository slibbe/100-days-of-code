# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6: 23 January 2019

**Today's Progress**: #100DaysOfCode #day6 Continued on the PacktPub 'Learn Go in 3 hours' video. Yesterday's getting stuck was caused by 4 typo's and 2 missing lines ðŸ˜‚  So yes, I was tired. 
Continued the course until installing dep (which seems to be Go's Composer, if you're familiar with PHP). Installing was a bit messy as GOBIN appears not to be set in GitBash/Windows 10 environments. Fix: export GOBIN="C:\Users\<username>\go\bin"

**Thoughts**: Tired, need some sleep now.

**Thoughts**: changed the order of this logfile for more practicality. Will need to think of some assignments to practise.
For example: 
1. [Find the Longest Word in a String](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/find-the-longest-word-in-a-string)
2. [Title Case a Sentence](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/title-case-a-sentence)

### Day 1: 18 January 2019

**Today's Progress**: #100DaysOfCode #day1 Yesterday started with an Introduction to Go. Just want to really 'learn' another relevant language instead of just looking at code and more or less know what it (c/sh)ould do. Using PacktPub 'Learn Go in 3 hours' video.

**Thoughts:** Apart from learning Go, I should also spent some time on 'actual work'.
