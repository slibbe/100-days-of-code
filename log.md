### Day 13: 19 February 2019

**Today's Progress**: #100DaysOfCode #day13 Finished Generative Adversarial Networks from PacktPub.  Need to have a look at Tensorflow and AWS Lambda. Really wondering if I will be able to make good use of this anytime soon.

 **Problem**:

### Day 11: 29 January 2019

**Today's Progress**: #100DaysOfCode #day11 Design exercise, describe problem and structure in MarkDown, start with solution in Go. At this time I feel that I should do some practise before picking up another book, since after some experience explanations tend to make more sense.

 **Problem**: Have text in two (or more columns) split in two parts, place other arbitrary string in the middle, and print total file again.
 
 **Thoughts**: This could be done easily in bash ;-)

### Day 10: 28 January 2019

**Today's Progress**: #100DaysOfCode #day10 Finishing the PacktPub Learn Go in 3 Hours course. 
The end of this course is the start of Go in my real life ;-)

**Thoughts**: Now what?

### Day 8: 25 January 2019

**Today's Progress**: #100DaysOfCode #day8 Publishing package to github, changing old keys config to newer set. Old one is from cygwin/bash while new one is from VSCode/gitbash in different location. #confusing

### Day 7: 24 January 2019

**Today's Progress**: #100DaysOfCode #day7 Continued on the PacktPub 'Learn Go in 3 hours' video. Installing dep was a challenge yesterday, getting it working as it is supposed to is yet another challenge for today. Finally found that 'dep init' has to be done like this: $GOPATH/bin/dep init while you are in the src directory. 

**Thoughts**: Not sure that this is practicle but fine for just now. #creating_technical_debthðŸ¤“

### Day 6: 23 January 2019

**Today's Progress**: #100DaysOfCode #day6 Continued on the PacktPub 'Learn Go in 3 hours' video. Yesterday's getting stuck was caused by 4 typo's and 2 missing lines ðŸ˜‚  So yes, I was tired. 
Continued the course until installing dep (which seems to be Go's Composer, if you're familiar with PHP). Installing was a bit messy as GOBIN appears not to be set in GitBash/Windows 10 environments. Fix: export GOBIN="C:\Users\<username>\go\bin"

**Thoughts**: Tired, need some sleep now.

### Day 4: 21 January 2019

**Today's Progress**: #100DaysOfCode #day4 Continued on the PacktPub 'Learn Go in 3 hours' video: Control Structures, Functions and Pointers

**Thoughts**: changed the order of this logfile for more practicality. Will need to think of some assignments to practise.
For example: 
1. [Find the Longest Word in a String](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/find-the-longest-word-in-a-string)
2. [Title Case a Sentence](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/title-case-a-sentence)

### Day 1: 18 January 2019

**Today's Progress**: #100DaysOfCode #day1 Yesterday started with an Introduction to Go. Just want to really 'learn' another relevant language instead of just looking at code and more or less know what it (c/sh)ould do. Using PacktPub 'Learn Go in 3 hours' video.

**Thoughts:** Apart from learning Go, I should also spent some time on 'actual work'.
