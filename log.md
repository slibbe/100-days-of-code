**Today's Progress**: #100DaysOfCode #day4 Continued on the PacktPub 'Learn Go in 3 hours' video: Control Structures, Functions and Pointers

**Thoughts**: changed the order of this logfile for more practicality. Will need to think of some assignments to practise.
For example: 
1. [Find the Longest Word in a String](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/find-the-longest-word-in-a-string)
2. [Title Case a Sentence](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/title-case-a-sentence)

### Day 1: 18 January 2019

**Today's Progress**: #100DaysOfCode #day1 Yesterday started with an Introduction to Go. Just want to really 'learn' another relevant language instead of just looking at code and more or less know what it (c/sh)ould do. Using PacktPub 'Learn Go in 3 hours' video.

**Thoughts:** Apart from learning Go, I should also spent some time on 'actual work'.
